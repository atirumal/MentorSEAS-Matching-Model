# MentorSEAS Matching Model

This project is a machine learning model to match ~1100 incoming UCLA Engineering students with ~250 suitable student mentors every school year. To pair the students, we considered factors such as personalities, shared interests, and career goals extracted from the studentsâ€™ survey responses which were sent over the summer. 
The basis of this model runs on stable matches created using Gale-Shapley algorithm with a Recurrent Neural Network.  
The final product is a list of matches that accurately pairs mentors and students based on their similarities.
